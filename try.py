reviews =['It is very nice. I liked it very much because it suits on my face. Quality is also very good.', "This is highly disappointing. Took all the measure to take a good care of it. Wore it on a few occasions and were great. I always kept them in the pouch provided. Puch is decent and doesn't bend. took these out after a month and what I see is a broken frame right on top of the lens. No Idea how and why? Friends laughed outrightly denying these being original FastTrack sunglasses. Wasted 500 Bucks. Never buying again from Cloud tail.", "I really like this product  because it's quality is very good according to the price the frame and the lense is very durable and it really protect from UV rays and we get very clear image. I wear it and I feel a little pain in my eyes but this is for some time especially when I wear it on some dark places. I like it's packaging because it is packed in good quality and durable case and I am very happy because it is delivered to my home within 3 days and it's a fastrack product so it is trusted and durable. So I give 5 stars to this product it is value for money.", "The media could not be loaded. I like the product because it's light weight , comfort but I have disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è when I have seen the product is coming country of oriigin China though fastrack is very original product of India , manufacturing by Titan , then how an importer can dare to brought this product ? We know from experience of Ladhak situation is still going on and Indian government banned all chinese product , I am sending a sticker which is tagged with fastrack sunglass by video or photo that provides proof to other people also..and now I am thinking that sunglass is a genuine one or not.", 'I use this during my last Himaalayan expeditions , really I enjoyed within.', "Amazing glasses. Very much comfortable. The green shade is just perfect. Cools eyes in bright sunlight. I don't step out without my them. Highly recommended.", 'Very bad defective product', 'Mastt sunglasses Amazon product so good look Thanks to Amazon', "Although i have other brand sunglasses, I bought this because of it's price and to try out a different brand.but after using it couple of times i kept it inside the cover. when i reopened it after two months what i saw is the frame is broken which is strange and i doubt whether this is a genuine product. Few people have also reviewed with the same problem and i ignored that while buying.Please don't buy otherwise you will regret later. Cheap quality product. I would have given -100 if that rating was there. Give that amount to some poor and needy if you really want to utilize that money.", 'The media could not be loaded. They have not provided a cover case  its jst packed in a cardboard box by fastrack üòîthis is so annoying', "Instead of Green Color Fast track Goggle , Black Color Goggle has been delivered. We kept complete  faith on ur advertisement. It's a case of Wrongful  Misrepresentation. I am ur regular and old customer.", 'Great', "Has some power in the glass. Feels very much fake. Not really comfortable to the sight. I have owned the model before and I can pretty much say this one that's being sold here is fake, although usable nonetheless", "Got it in a sale for a really great price... At that point I wasn't expecting it would look so good in real... I was just having a wish to get a nice quality Sunglasses to block sunlight didn't cared how it looked on me... I have a little sensitive eyes to sunlight & I have been a bad Kite flyer for that sole reason... I wasn't expecting anything about looks... As till now I was an aviator lover... Never went on about wayfarers... But it came out to be entirely awesome... Quality: The name says it all Fastrack. But to be more clear if you had no experience of wearing a HQ sunglasses then I must tell you its a very good experience... These sunglasses are unlike cheap ones which would render everything black... And you would feel everything is covered in black mist... But with fastrack it all felt like a naturally clean layer of protection is placed on your eyes... I mean the level of details would be very clear... Unlike a cheap sunglass which tend to get damaged & dirty easily, which would worsen the already low quality vision... Style: You are sure to turn heads with this one... Everyone will recognize fastrack... It definitely adds an essence of style... I mean if you are a stylish person... Then it would make you stand out & prove to be a good addition to your wardrobe... Good Luck...", 'Sabse pehle jo mere yaha delivery boy ata hain good behavior hain and kabi bhi late nahi hua sunglasses me sab kuch thik hain acha hain paisa wasool hai lekin sunglasses case nahi diya hain only hard paper box hain bas ye galat hain chashme ki safety nahi ho sakti kyunki bande ne agar utar ke rakhna hain to paper box me rakhega wo bhi kab tak paper ka dabba to fat hi jayega na', 'This is the best budget wayfarer in budget. I say budget, but still solves the purpose handsomely. The quality is not compromised. The lens, the frame, the allignment between frame and lens, the size , everything is perfect. No flaws. I was expecting a hard zipper case, but received a hard carton, which is of no use for storage. A good quality micromiber glass cloth, much bigger than the normal ones is useful. This is not a polarized sunglasses, but not a big deal, the quality is much better than the polarised sunglasses from lesser known brands available in this price bracket.', "Its not perfect black but honestly you really don't need to wear all black it feels uncomfortable while driving and this one UV protected as well as some short of polarized too so while driving at daytime everything's is clear and punchy in colour. And quality is good as a fastrack brand.", 'I ordered small (41) size, Gray colour goggles. Amazon delivered it quickly. it\'s very nice goggles. I travel for 2 hours on bike, it is very cool. The seller "Cloudtail India. Pvt. Ltd"  specially recommended, thanks Amazon. PROS :-- Polycarbonate lenses UV400 protection Good build material Comfortable for face & Eye Good for outdoor & bike ride Protection from sunlight & dust At very affordable price CONS -- nothing', 'Do not expect much from the product...its very light almost like any other product on roadside..the mark of fastract makes it stand out a bit..its beautiful in design. its decent sunglass considering the amount you are paying but still below my expectation...the packing is good and I like the case more than the glass itself..the case is very nice.', "I got broken seal and with screeched product at 1st time even without case of it which is shown in the video on Amazon. I ordered for replacement but than after I got sunglasses with out case even the quality is not expected when it's fastrack product which is usually providing a good quality. more over I conformed about the case for this sunglasses from Amazon customer care via amazon app. and I got confirmation that the case is also included with this sunglasses same as that shown in the video. I would like to suggest to all, please do not buy this product from this same seller. other wise there are lots of chances of that you will face that same things what I faced."]
