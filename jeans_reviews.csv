0,Good product according to price .
1,"Just one issue. The advertisement tells you this is a regular fit. But it is a slim fit and a not regular one. If you are a regular fit guy, this jeans will hold your legs tight. Material is thick, stretchable and ok. Other measurements, waist size, length, color are fine. But stitching is bit loose. After wearing for 3 times, today the keys which I kept in my left pocket dropped down through my legs from the loose stitch."
2,"I loved it.. Just go for it.. Been a customer of Amazon for long. Wear it n see (keep the tags as it is/If u want a different color or size,  return with exchange. Don't call Cc. Just visit the app n tick return,  exchange. N u will be happy soon). Just go for it.. See my pics if u want to. Good luck.. (Good pricing. Good stitch as I see it. ðŸ˜Š)"
3,"This is the second time I have bought Ben Martin Jeans with same specifications. Waist size is accurate but the fit is skinny-slim rather than relaxed (bought this exactly knowing this). The jeans as a whole is well stitched, with good quality materials (my previous one is almost 2 years now). Good value for money in this price range."
4,"The Size, length, and waist of pant are just as expected. But the quality of pant surprises me. Is this really a jeans. I am sure in the first wash its color will fade. Secondly the stiching from side, threads coming out from it. All together not a valuable price, atleast not at this price. You Can easily get it in under Rs500"
5,The product quality is good For the product fitting not relaxed fit can say it is slim fit
6,"Looks verry good quality,fits perfectly, let's see how many does it last."
7,Nice jeans . I like it.  Best jeans at low Price.
8,"Since lockdown I reduced by 15kgs and existing pants were very loose , so wanted to try without steping out of my home . Found this pant 32 inch dead cheap and went for it . Surprise surprise it was a perfect fit and the quality of stich and fabric was found good . Yet to wash bit at the outset very satisfied . Thanks Amazon."
9,Quality ia good but this pant number is 32.. but i want 33 number and 33 number is not develop directly 34 number is available but 34 number is i think too loose for me so.. i am compromise on32 number..
10,Cheap quality material. But I had to see it coming at this price point. Do yourself a favour and buy a pair of pant from a good brand. Jeans ar meant to last longer and should be comfortable to wear every day.
11,I am writing this review 4 month after buying. I was ordering any clothes first time from online buying option. I was doubtful about fitting and quality of cloth. but I got a really cheap and good quality product. perfect fit and no color fading issue.
12,I ordered this item for the 2nd time same size .1st time its colour was same as i ordered but this time not same the colour is much different then the product shown in the picture.....& For that i give 4 star...
13,It's Narrow Fit. Not the product you see in the picture Not comfortable in wearing if your Thigh got Muscle. I got it in 329. Hence it's a good deal if it works for a Year only or so... I'll manage.
14,"Good jeans, only material not much soft, it rough, colour doesn't got fedded yet in Feb'2022."
15,At waist its a bit tight for me. It is difficult to take out things from the side pockets. The pant is product wise very comfortable and value for money
16,"Very very bad quality, don't purchase this product."
17,This size very too slim and small fiting I'm return this product not sure full money return refunds
18,Product is good as compared to price. But the product is completely different from the picture.
19,"Product fabrics are good but somewhat thin, very narrow, so tight in entire leg length, colour also fine, stretch factor working fine, price within limits."
