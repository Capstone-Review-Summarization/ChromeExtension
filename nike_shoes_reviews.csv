These are ideal for people with wide feet. Grip is very good for the price, and comfort is pretty decent too. Got it on sale for 3395. Amazing. 09/10 go for it."
1,"very bad, there is a metal piece at the back, realised after wearing for day and ended up with bruise near ankle, looks like refurbished shoes"
2,It's not at all breathable after wearing for some hours it gets bad odour...air circulation absent....cause sweat to accumulate causing damage to feet skin ....I recommend not to buy it...
